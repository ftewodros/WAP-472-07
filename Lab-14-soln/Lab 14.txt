Implement the features below inside shoppingcart-client project. This project acts as SPA which make calls to shoppingcart-server APIs. You must have strong knowledge on JavaScript DOM APIs to complete the tasks. I highly recommand you to do this part if you have time.
Modify index.html, carousel.css to match your design
Write JS code in main.js to implement the feature:
List all books in index.html when open index.html in browser
Click "Submit" button to add a new book with properties: title, ISBN, publishedDate, author (id is auto generated)
Click "Update" button to Edit a book and save to server side
Click "Delete" button to remove a book from server side
